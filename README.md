=======

REST API/Websocket backend for the MMOTD project. Built using Flask, MongoDB and Redis. Initially we'll be deploying to dotcloud for simplicity's sake but

This is a collaborative experiment to build a massively* multiplayer tower defence game.  The goal here isn't to be ground breaking or earth shattering, but to have fun playing with some shiny APIs and building something just because we can.

If you'd like to help then please get in touch @paddycarey on twitter.

All code will be released under the MIT license.

*maybe, at some point, hopefully
